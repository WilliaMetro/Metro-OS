Metro-OS

Made by Metro Studio 🙂

Metro-OS is a fun project that works like a small operating system.
It lets you try simple commands with CMD, DOS, and Python.
You can open files, explore folders, and play around like a real OS.

📂 Project Folders

/Metro-OS-gui (Python) → GUI version (⚠️ currently broken, may crash)

/Metro-OS-legacy (Python) → Old version, still works

/Metro-OS (Python) → Main version

/osnew (Batch) → Original Windows batch version

⚠️ Warning

The GUI version (Metro-OS-gui) is not working right now.
