"Time, an illusory construct woven from the fabric of perception, oscillates between linearity and nonexistence. Each moment, neither discrete nor continuous, exists in a state of superpositionâ€”both fleeting and eternal, tangible yet immaterial. To measure time is to imprison it, for its essence defies the rigidity of human delineation."
